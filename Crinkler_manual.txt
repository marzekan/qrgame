Executable file compressing tutorial (all command lines are executed from Developer Command Prompt).

1) Unzip crinkler23 folder and extract Win32 folder
2) Open Win32 folder and place name.c file in there
3) Next, you have to compile that name.c file using command: cl /c name.c

Once you have name.obj file, the fun starts :P. For now you will use the default linker to perform compression

4) Use command: link.exe name.obj /entry:WinMain /defaultlib:user32.lib /defaultlib:kernel32.lib /verbose > out.txt
   to get executable file and .txt file that will be used for help
4.5) Make sure that compression was succesful by running the name.exe file

Now we are getting closer to using crinkler for compression. But first open out.txt file
in your favorite editor and search for texts simmilar to this (the path may be different):
	Searching C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\lib\10.0.18362.0\um\x86\user32.lib:
	(key word is Searching)
	
ONLY (rember this ONLY, because other paths are not needed) IF there is text underneath it like this one:
	Found __imp__TranslateMessage@4
        Referenced in name.obj
        Loaded user32.lib(USER32.dll)
	
you should copy that path. You should repeat this "finding process" until you find all DIFFERENT paths.
Once you have (in my case 3 of them), in Developer Command Prompt write following command:
	crinkler.exe name.obj "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\lib\10.0.18362.0\um\x86\user32.lib" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\BuildTools\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.27.29110\lib\x86\LIBCMT.lib" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\lib\10.0.18362.0\um\x86\kernel32.lib" /entry:WinMain

Only difference is that inside quotation marks, you should write your own paths found
in algorithm above.
OR you can write the .bat file where you will write this same command.
